## Files

| File | Used for | Source variant |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `claude.svg` | Claude (claude.ai) | `claude-color` (coloured) |
| `openai.svg` | ChatGPT | `openai` (monochrome), recoloured to ChatGPT teal `#10A37F` |
| `mistral.svg` | Le Chat (Mistral) | `mistral-color` (coloured) |
| `gemini.svg` | Gemini | `gemini-color` (coloured) |

All four logos carry an explicit `fill` so they remain visible on both light and dark themes. Lobe-icons' `currentColor` variants would only render correctly when embedded inline with surrounding CSS — GitHub serves SVGs through `<img>`, which strips that context.
