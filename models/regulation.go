// Phase identifies which regulation phase a learner is currently in.
// Decided by [2] PhaseController (engine/phase_fsm.go) and consumed by
// [4] ConceptSelector to choose the eligible-concept pool and scoring
// formula. See docs/regulation-design/04-concept-selector.md §4.
//
// Callers must pass an explicit phase — there is no implicit default
// at the SelectConcept boundary, by design (an unrecognised phase
// returns an explicit error rather than silently degrading; cf.
// OQ-4.1). Bootstrap differs by entry point:
//   - New domains created via init_domain are written with phase
//     PhaseDiagnostic explicitly (tools/domain.go).
//   - Pre-existing domains with NULL phase (created before the phase
//     column existed) are treated by the orchestrator as
//     PhaseInstruction in-memory (engine/orchestrator.go:75-77) until
//     a transition causes UpdateDomainPhase to persist a value.
